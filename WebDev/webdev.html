        Welcome. Hopefully this ends up amounting to something but I want to take the limited time I have this winter (2020, panedmic, can't socialize / do anything outside), to actually learn a bit of web development. Maybe this break will be different than
        every other break. Links are in increaseing order of development of skills unless theirs only one lol.
