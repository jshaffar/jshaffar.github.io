<font face="times new roman, serif">	I am probably not qualified to
discuss this topic and don’t really have time to find that much
evidence for my takes so take everything said with a grain of salt.
However, I am really interested in foreign policy and read a lot
about it. Also the foreign policy establishment is smarter, but often
treats the world as a giant risk game without thinking about the
consequences of their actions on the actual people, so in my opinion
we need more average Joe’s to discuss foreign policy. </font>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="times new roman, serif">	I
think information warfare has been one of the more overrated
developments in the world. “The Perfect Weapon” by David Sanger
gave us the perspective from someone in the BLOB, who tried to stress
how existentially important information warfare was for our future.
Admittedly it seems scary: Russia hacked our election and installed a
Manchurian-candidate like figure that destroyed all our institutions.
</font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="times new roman, serif">	Firstly
Trump was not elected primarily because of Russia. This argument
always seemed more like a coping mechanism by liberals. Much stronger
reasons for why Trump won were running an uncharismatic candidate
that was character assassinated for years by the right wing media. I
actually think she was an incredibly qualified candidate and part of
the reason for people hating her was sexism, but that doesn’t
change the fact that most Americans range from indifferent to her to
considering her some sort of anti-Christ. It also doesn’t hurt that
we have an incredibly quirky and undemocratic system to select the
president. There were 75,316 people in several states who had they
all voted differently would’ve changed the electoral calculus (1).
This is admittedly not a lot of votes they needed to swing, but
that’s still significant (based on five-thirty-eight .8% of the
votes in important states). It is at best ambiguous whether had
Russia not hacked the election Hillary would’ve won. For comparison
to other interests however, the Russians spent 1.25 million dollars,
while Trump spent 617 million dollars, and Clinton spent 1.2 billion
dollars (4). Yes we should care more about Russian spending because
it it an attempt to subvert our democracy, but based strictly on
effectiveness there seems to be other more important factors.  </font>
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="times new roman, serif">	Let’s
suppose that the Russians were able to flip enough voters in swing
states to change the outcome of the election. In this case what did
their information warfare actually accomplish. As “The Perfect
Weapons” nicely shows, Trump clearly had a respect for Russia’s
capabilities, “even claiming he admired Putin’s strength” (5).
Trump for all his faults and weirdness towards Russia didn’t really
do anything for them. He opposed pro-Russian regimes in Syria and
Venezuela. He also continued through executive orders to apply
sanctions even specifically for hacking elections, (2) in addition to
other Russian actions. Yes Trump was pro-Russian in his rhetoric, but
his actions never lined up. Maybe we are just lucky, and a second
term Trump would have fulfilled a threat of withdrawing from NATO
(3). And who knows how Trump would’ve reacted had Russia invaded
Ukraine during his presidency. However these actions never
materialized, and we cannot judge the effectiveness of hypotheticals.</font></p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="times new roman, serif">	The
cost of warfare is not simply the equipment and lives. Information
warfare is relatively cheap in this respect, costing very little to
wage, and generally not directly killing anyone. However, this
information warfare cost Russia a large amount. This is the primary
reason why just general information warfare without much focus is
mostly a bad idea. Russia made the party who was generally a bit more
dovish, into a party completely full of absolute Russia haters. Yes
he divided the country, but a large part of that division involved
dividing the country against your own country. People don’t like
having their elections hacked obviously. The republican party minus a
small vocal pro-Putin element already hated Russia. Why alienate the
other half of the country.  I don’t think Putin thinks of the
Russian people too much either, but sanctions are not good for your
people. If the general Russian person on the street had the choice
whether to create a worse economy in exchange for slightly
influencing the United States presidential election and dividing the
American public, I think the answer would be pretty obvious. We
sometimes have the tendency that countries are actually just their
people, and what benefits the country should at least benefit their
people. </font>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in"><font face="times new roman, serif">	The
west’s response to the invasion of Ukraine has completely shown the
limits of international information warfare. This could’ve been the
information warriors time to shine. They could’ve lead the
narrative in the west that the Ukrainian government were evil Nazis
whose people required liberation. However, the general narrative in
most of the west has been almost uniformly negative. Maybe it’s
hard to change minds against something so obviously evil, but maybe a
more useful application would be to show how much progress the
Russian forces were making in their campaign, and how scared the west
should be. However they have been completely unsuccessful at this as
well.</font></p>

<font face="times new roman, serif">	Information warfare sounds sexy
and modern which is why people talk about it, but seems overrated as
a policy tool, and even in the effected country doesn’t necessarily
have the effect people want. On a domestic level it is very important
to control the narrative. However as a tool for warfare at least in
the way Russia implemented it, it’s pretty unsuccessful, and can
often backfire by making everyone hate you. This is why I don’t
necessarily agree with sentiments in the reading like <span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="background: transparent">“</span></span></font></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#000000"><span style="text-decoration: none"><font size="2" style="font-size: 11pt"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal"><span style="background: transparent">It
